DARREN NICOL CAPSTONE PROJECT README

This project was started as a fundraising campaign between two organisations (Nudge UK Limited SC460309 and Siyakhathala Orphans Registered charity NPO 068-260). 

Nudge is Darren’s talent company and he struck up the relationship with Siyakhathala Orphans whilst volunteering in Cape Town, South Africa.  

The concept was to create a site where we could sell digital art via the website open sea. It also allows orders to be taken for merchandise and for donations to be made to the orphanage. 

It does have elements of an ecommerce platform (the merchandise) but it is not an ecommerce site. The objectives of the site were to: - 

•	Showcase the charity
•	Establish a presence and connect to the Open sea NFT marketplace
•	Create credibility in the NFT marketplace 
•	Allow individuals to register on the site and log interest and bid for each NFT
•	Educate those that wish to enter the NFT space
•	Allow sales of merch to raise funds

The site itself utilizes Django (including User/ Auction/ Bid and comment models) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end. The structure includes: - 

•	Models- Classes are User, Auction, Bid, Comment and Watchlist
•	URLs- 18 in total to direct to required pages 
•	Pages- 18 pages in total, typical front end pages (Home, about us, as well as merchandise page and listings pages)

There are also a number of links to other sites such as rarible, ecologi,  B Corp and MetaMask, all of which provides educational materials and credible links to improve SEO.  The main API is to Open sea marketplace where we can sell the orphans digital art. 

The web application is also mobile-responsive. The aim was to create something that could be used in practice rather than sitting on a github repo. I have done this by hosting the site in AWS and is now a live operating site that is raising funds for the charity with sales of circa $500 to date. 

I’ll continue to host this site, sales of the NFTs haven’t taken off as hoped but it needs a marketing effort rather than any issue with the functionality of the site. 

I’ve really enjoyed all the projects and believe I have created a site that is: -   

Distinctive 

There are a number of NFT marketplaces out there open seas/ rarible etc, we want ed to build a site that would provide credibility to our NFT offerings in Open sea, so purchasers could visit our site and find out more about our collab. We also wanted to provide a site for donations to be made to the charity which by buying merchandise, so the site was part marketing part fund raise. 

Complexity 

There was a level of complexity that I feel meets the course requirements. Is the site amazing, not really, there is so much more I’d like to learn to do and apply to the site, but it does achieve what it set out to do and is functional. It allows individuals to register, view the digital art, link to auction site, and to purchase merchandise. This took front end design skills, backend skills to save users and API work to connect to payments and to the NFT site itself. 

In order to run the project, you have to undertake the following steps: - 

•	Open command line
•	Navigate to folder (file path: ebdjango)
•	python3 manage.py runserver
